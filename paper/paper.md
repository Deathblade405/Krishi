**Abstract**

Agricultural well-being and rural development are two central components
of India\'s policy strategy. Nevertheless, efficient delivery and
implementation of government initiatives and new practices by rural
farming communities are a tall order with linguistic diversity, digital
illiteracy, and information imbalance. In this paper, we investigate the
use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in developing a
multilingual conversational farmer assistant, known as Krishi Mitra. The
model combines Large Language Models (LLMs), voice interfaces, knowledge
lookup, and context-sensitive generation to bridge the gap in access to
government schemes and agriculture knowledge. We scrape agriculture
welfare data, train vector embeddings, and build a real-time assistant
generating accurate, region-aware answers in local Indian languages in
real-time. Our findings show that RAG-enabled assistants improve
response factuality by a large margin, reduce hallucination, and boost
user satisfaction. The research demands India-specific linguistic and
infrastructural context-based rural support systems that are based on
AI.

**1. Introduction**

> India boasts the world\'s largest rural population with more than 70%
> of its population residing in villages and relying mainly on
> agriculture as a source of income. With socio-economic importance,
> agriculture is still beset by age-old problems, especially that of
> information sharing and availability of information critical to the
> health and productivity of the rural farmers. Schemes like PM-KISAN,
> which offer direct income support, PMFBY, which offers crop insurance,
> and e-NAM, which facilitates online agricultural trade, have been
> launched by the government to transform and benefit the rural
> agriculture space. Yet, noted uptake and use of such initiatives is
> woefully low because of a range of determinants such as lack of
> awareness, educational disadvantage, digital illiteracy, lack of good
> internet infrastructure, linguistic diversity, and lack of local
> accessible information delivery systems. This has been further widened
> by the digital divide between rural and urban India, wherein urban
> citizens have access to a broad range of AI-based and digital public
> services whereas rural farmers are unaware or cannot avail of such
> technology. The refusal of official websites to be browsed, the
> prevalence of English and Hindi on the web, and the lack of proper
> assimilation of local languages render it a case of exclusion of vast
> portions of rural citizens. While conversational AI models based on
> large language models (LLMs) empower GPT-4, BERT, and other models to
> transform information searching and human-machine interaction in
> cities, the models\' performance deteriorates significantly when
> implemented in multilingual, low-literacy rural environments. The
> models are susceptible to the generation of false data, known as
> hallucinations, are not capable of naturally supporting Indian
> regional languages, are unable to preserve context while engaged in
> multi-turn dialogues, and are unable to ground themselves upon
> real-world data. To counteract these issues, this research introduces
> Krishi Mitra -- a dialogue-based AI assistant specifically designed
> for Indian farmers. Krishi Mitra relies on the Retrieval-Augmented
> Generation (RAG) architecture that facilitates improved quality and
> accuracy of AI answers by drawing upon retrieval components that pull
> data from tested government databases, agricultural websites, and
> research libraries prior to generating an answer. In contrast to
> conventional chatbots, Krishi Mitra is based on precise, real-time
> facts and enables both text and voice-based interaction in several
> regional languages including Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, and
> Bengali. It is thus highly accessible to farmers of any literacy level
> or technical know-how. The assistant is not only capable of producing
> output in text form but also in synthesized speech voice as well as
> even visual forms such as graphs or pictures if needed, providing a
> multimodal interface responsive to varying needs of the users. The
> software is designed to operate in low-connectivity conditions as well
> as on low-power devices, so even rural villagers from far-flung areas
> are able to make use of its functionality. Apart from this, Krishi
> Mitra would be upgraded in the future with fresh government schemes,
> farm advisories, market statistics, and state news as and when they
> are available. In the paper, the design aspects, implementation
> tactics, and performance evaluation of Krishi Mitra are discussed,
> with various combinations of LLMs, embedding models, and vector
> databases compared to identify the best architecture for rural
> deployment. In addition, the social benefits of implementing such a
> system are also taken into account, such as facilitating more
> participation in the scheme, enhancing farm decision-making, less
> reliance on intermediaries, and digital inclusion. Merging speech
> recognition and synthesis into local dialects is a paradigm change in
> the interface, which becomes conversational, simple, and even viable
> for the digitally illiterate. Krishi Mitra is not just imagined as a
> chatbot, but as a digital agrarian companion---a one that informs and
> enables farmers, makes support more accessible, and closes the
> existing gap between technology and rural existence. Given that
> agriculture is exposed to new environmental, economic, and social
> threats, innovations such as Krishi Mitra are well positioned to show
> the transformational potential of inclusive AI systems designed for
> equity, sustainability, and empowerment of rural India.

**2. Literature Review**

> Use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in natural language
> processing has come a long way with its capacity to enhance factual
> accuracy and evidential support of generative models. RAG models, in
> contrast to conventional LLMs that only depend on pre-trained data,
> offer retrieval using a reliable corpus and generative modeling,
> leading to richer contextual and credible outputs. Ji et al. (2022)
> \[28\] prepared a comprehensive review of hallucination in natural
> language generation and found that RAG is one of the top architectures
> to address such problems, especially in safety-critical applications.
> Huayang et al. (2022) \[25\] also reviewed the landscape of RAG models
> and described their use in enriching information retrieval towards
> domain-related scenarios.
>
> These studies determine why factual coherence in the generated
> responses is significantly enhanced as models are based on external
> document sources. CortÃ©s-Cediel et al. (2023) \[17\] further discussed
> the application of RAG in public administration use, citing that
> RAG-based systems improved participatory citizenship and trust since
> policy vocabulary is better clarified. Such advantages are highly
> useful in rural and agriculture technology. The capability to render
> sophisticated government schemes in vernacular and context-sensitive
> formats gives RAG high prospects for digital inclusiveness in rural
> governments. In addition, the continuous updating of features in
> software such as Memo-RAG and Iter-RetGen provides multi-hop reasoning
> enhancements that allow for more sophisticated queries to be responded
> to via long-context document streams---something very relevant for
> schemes that have hierarchical eligibility or state-dependent
> restrictions. This paper develops such RAG breakthroughs and
> recontextualizes them within an Indian rural setting, prioritizing
> language diversity and access issues.

**3. Methodology**

This section addresses the data ingestion pipeline, data pre-processing,
and embedding method used to provide the RAG-based system. Data were
extracted from over 3,000 schemes of agriculture from public websites
such as MyScheme.gov.in and state-agriculture portals. Every scheme
record contained metadata like eligibility, benefit, required documents,
application process, and FAQs. The unstructured data were cleaned,
normalized, and placed in structured JSON format. For semantic search,
the textual material was mapped to vector embeddings with two models:
Google\'s models/embedding-001 and nomic-embed-text. The embeddings were
kept in ChromaDB to enable fast semantic lookup. The data ingestion
pipeline was constructed with Python 3.10.12, Selenium for dynamic
content scraping, and LangChain document loader utilities for ingesting
scheme content. A FastAPI backend was employed to construct an API for
serving responses and queries. This configuration allowed the
application to provide region-specific information with high accuracy
and low latency. This study employs an extensive methodology with the
purpose of building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven
multilingual chatbot model that will give rural citizens precise and
meaningful information while they seek government schemes. The
methodology starts with web scraping structured as well as unstructured
information from web pages like MyScheme.gov.in and other state
government agricultural portal sites. Over 3,000 schemes were
programmatically crawled using Python scripts and Selenium dynamic web
scraping. Information on each scheme, such as title, benefits,
eligibility, documents, and application process, were cleaned, filtered,
and transformed into a uniform JSON format for preserving consistency
and ease in downstream processing.

The cleaned data were further translated into semantic vector embeddings
using two models of embeddings: Google\'s models/embedding-001 and
Nomic\'s nomic-embed-text. These embeddings are the text\'s semantic
content and have been preserved in ChromaDB, a high-performance,
scalable vector database optimized for semantic retrieval. With this,
the system can provide responses with the relevant pieces of information
by matching the user\'s query against the nearest textual fragments.
After creating the pipeline for data ingestion and storage, the query
processing layer was implemented using FastAPI for backend interactions
and React for frontend rendering. The user communicates with the system
using voice or text commands, which are processed by Google\'s
Speech-to-Text API and Translation API to translate the command into
English. The translated query is then converted to a vector and compared
against the ChromaDB index to obtain some scheme information. This
learned knowledge is then transferred to a Large Language Model
(LLM)---such as Gemini Pro or LLaMA3---so that not just is the response
contextually accurate but it also comes from real knowledge. The final
output is then converted back into the user\'s language of preference
and communicated through text and speech by Google\'s Text-to-Speech
API. This multimodal, multilingual pipe guarantees access to scheme data
for linguistic and educational users under all circumstances including
low-resource, offline-first environments. With the synergy of real-time
retrieval capability and LLMs\' generation capacity, the system
minimizes hallucinations, maximizes semantic accuracy, and produces
responses in a readable format optimal for India\'s rural masses.

**4. Experimental Result:**

All the model evaluation experiments were performed using two LLMs,
Gemini 1.5 Pro and LLaMA3, and two embedding models. Model performance
was evaluated with and without RAG integration, comparing metrics such
as similarity score, uncertainty, and hallucination rate. The evaluation
results with different setups are presented in Tables 5--7. LLMs were
inconsistent and fact-grounding-deficient without RAG, but with the
integration of RAG, the system produced much more trusted output.
Interestingly, the Gemini + models/embedding-001 configuration logged
highest similarity scores and lowest hallucination rates. The semantic
search mechanism was best able to limit most appropriate scheme records,
enhancing model accuracy for a broad spectrum of user prompts in several
languages. The results confirm the efficacy of mashing up retrieval with
generative operations for rural, multilingual use cases.

Initialization and Setup: The scraper is intended to scrape government
agricultural welfare websites, i.e., MyScheme.gov.in and state
agriculture department websites. It uses Selenium WebDriver with
Chrome/Firefox to handle dynamic web elements and scrape data displayed
through JavaScript. Collecting Scheme Links and Basic Information: The
scraper browses through the portal landing page, waits until content
loads completely, and collects basic scheme details like scheme name,
category, location, and detail page links. All this information is
formatted and stored in a list of dictionaries for later processing.

Fetching Detailed Information: In each of the schemes listed above, the
scraper visits the detail page and fetches structured information like
scheme description, eligibility, benefits, required documents,
application procedure, and FAQs. Exception handling procedures are
present in it so that data extraction goes uninterrupted even when there
are missing fields or pages are being displayed in an irregular way.
Data Gathering: The data scraped is populated into the related scheme
entries within the dictionary list. After completing the scraping
process, the browser session is destroyed and the full dataset is
gathered into one collective JSON structure.

RAG Chain: The Krishi Mitra platform uses a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) chain on the scraped information. When a user
voice/text input is received, the appropriate vector-embedded chunks of
scheme data are retrieved and fed as input to an LLM in order to produce
a correct reply. The last structured data is saved in JSON file format.
The file has a comprehensive list of government agriculture schemes
along with metadata, prepared to be indexed, semantic searched, and
utilized by the Krishi Mitra assistant. Once the agricultural scheme
information is scraped and stored in JSON, the text is vectorized into
embeddings to facilitate semantic search effectively. The embeddings
capture the semantics of scheme-related text so that the system is able
to search and retrieve important information for user queries. Krishi
Mitra employs Gemini models/embedding-001 and Nomic-embed-text to
produce high-quality embeddings. These are saved in ChromaDB, allowing
for quick and precise similarity searches in the RAG framework.

**4.2. With RAG**

> The experiment compares two embedding models and two LLM models across
> three metrics. The results show that for similarity scores,
> \"models/embedding-001\" performs better than \"nomic-embed-text\"
> across both LLMs. In terms of uncertainty, the two embedding models
> have comparable scores, while for hallucination, \"nomic-embed-text\"
> produces significantly higher values, indicating more hallucinations
> across both LLMs.

> **5. Conclusion**
>
> Krishi Mitra shows that RAG + LLM architectures combined with local
> language voice/text interfaces can revolutionize rural access to
> information. Through reduction of hallucinations and localization
> improvement, the system enables farmers to make well-informed
> decisions and make optimal use of government schemes.

Indic TTS integration, offline-first training, and extension to weather
and crop advisory apps are some of the areas being pursued further.
Scaling such a system in India has the potential to usher inclusive
digital governance and data-driven agriculture.
